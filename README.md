# Moje-Dorota
I am a beginner software tester with a lot of life experience. I completed the course as a QA Engineer. I am currently in the process of ISTQB Foundation Level certification. I am looking for opportunities to gain experience. I am still in the process of expanding my knowledge towards IT and learning English.
